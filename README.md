🔗 Context API:
Thrilled to leverage React's Context API for my latest project! 🌐 Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. In the store.jsx, I've created a global context to manage state effortlessly across components. This makes state management cleaner and more scalable, especially in larger applications. #ReactContextAPI #StateManagement

🔄 useReducer Hook:
Diving deep into React's useReducer hook for streamlined state management! 🎣 This powerful hook simplifies complex state logic by handling state updates in a predictable way. In the reducer.jsx, I've defined clear actions like 'INCREMENT' and 'DECREMENT' to maintain a structured flow. Excited about the clean and maintainable code it brings to the table! #ReactHooks #useReducer #StateManagement
